The objective of this project is to develop a user-friendly airline reservation system that enables seamless booking and management of 
flight tickets. The system will utilize a secure MySQL database to store and manage passenger details, reservations, and transaction records. Users will be able to select their boarding points, destinations, and the number of tickets dynamically, with an integrated pricing module that calculates ticket costs based on predefined routes and additional luggage charges. Additionally, the system will provide cancellation functionality, allowing users to efficiently cancel their reservations when needed. A travel date modification feature will also be implemented to offer flexibility for passengers. Ensuring data integrity and security through proper validation and database transactions is a key focus of this project. Moreover, the system will be designed to be scalable and modular, allowing for future 
enhancements such as online payment integration.
