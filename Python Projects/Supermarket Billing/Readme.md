The Supermarket Billing System is a Python-based program designed to simplify and automate the checkout process in supermarkets. 
It allows users to add items to their cart, specifying the item name, price, and quantity. The system displays a detailed bill, 
including item-wise costs and the total amount. Users can remove items from the cart if needed before proceeding to checkout. 
A 5% discount is applied to encourage purchases, followed by an 18% GST calculation on the discounted amount. The final bill is
displayed with a breakdown of total cost, discount, tax, and the final payable amount. The program ensures accuracy in 
calculations and provides a seamless shopping experience. It also includes options to modify the cart before payment, enhancing user convenience. With an intuitive console interface, the system is user-friendly and easy to operate. This program is ideal for small 
to medium retail stores looking for a simple yet effective billing solution.
