 The pharmacy management system is to efficiently manage the stock of medicines, ensuring smooth inventory tracking and sales operations.
 It allows pharmacists to add new medicines with details such as name, price, and quantity while updating existing stock when required.
 The system ensures accurate record-keeping by maintaining real-time availability of medicines and preventing overselling when stock is insufficient. It provides a structured approach to monitoring medicine sales and calculating total revenue. Additionally, the system 
enhances transparency by displaying the current inventory, helping users make informed decisions. By automating the process, it reduces 
manual errors and saves time in managing pharmaceutical transactions. The software is designed to be user-friendly, ensuring ease of use
for pharmacists and store managers. It also helps in tracking medicine availability, preventing stock shortages, and ensuring timely restocking. Furthermore, the system improves business efficiency by maintaining updated pricing information. Overall, this project aims 
to streamline pharmacy operations, enhancing accuracy, reliability, and customer service.
